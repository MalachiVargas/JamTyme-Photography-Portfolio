Project Name: JamTymeProductions

Project Overview:
The goal is to create an elegant portfolio to display a photographer’s photos and videos with the intention of directing potential customers to future photo bookings.
The website is a portfolio that shares both the artist’s content and personality.
The intended users of the site are other photographers who enjoy the artist’s work, fans of the artist that want to learn more personal details, and customers that need photography for their (businesses, models, weddings, events).
The website will have five pages. The home page, about me, photo gallery, video reel, and pricing/booking information. Each site will have minimal design and a concise message leading to a call to action.

Home Page
Eye catching page that introduces the user to the artist’s work, presents quick call to actions to engage, and provides a quick overview of the site itself.
This page is for customers, audience from Instagram, Business partners.
The content will be one card with static images of each page of the site and links leading to those pages. The card will have a swipeable animation that will allow for easy browsing of the entire site structure. Just like every page, there will be a clean, simple navigation bar at the top for easy to find navigation.

About me - Jason Lyn
An “about me” page that describes the artist, what he does, his history, his plans, and shares all of his social media or contact information.
This page is for customers, audience from Instagram, business partners.
The content will be the logo of the site accompanied with a concise couple of paragraphs about the history of the artist. The artist wants to share what he feels will help connect him to his audience in a more sincere way.

Photo Gallery
A photo gallery page that takes the artist’s best photos and displays them in a unique and eye-catching format to best highlight the creativity and quality of his photos. 
This page is for customers, audience from Instagram, business partners.
The content will be the photos displayed in a Mondrianesque (art style) grid using css that will be responsive and move as the website window moves. The photos will light up on hover and allow you to click on each individually for a better, higher quality view.

Video Gallery
A video gallery page similar to the photography page that will display the artist’s best video work. The goal for this page is to keep the page as clean as possible so all the focus is on the video.
This page is for customers, audience from Instagram, business partners.
The content will be five to ten high quality videos that are formatted to highlight the brands and events the artist has worked with. The brand name will be displayed on the page under the biggest framed video.The videos will pop out in modal form on-click to isolate the viewer to that one video. The viewer can always click the exit button to get back to scanning over all videos.

Booking
A booking page where customers can schedule a session with the artist. The page will focus on the type of customers that the artist accepts as clients.
This page is for customers, models, businesses.
The content will be three categories of customers. The businesses, individual artists (models, singers, etc) and events (wedding). The paragraphs will describe experiences the artist has had in these categories and what the customer can expect when booking with the artist. At the bottom of the form, will be a visible form prompting the major information needed to schedule a session with the artist. The form is step-by-step,  meaning it will only prompt the artist one piece of information at a time. This is a great way to make the form process more engaging, and to keep the site clean of multiple ugly text boxes.
