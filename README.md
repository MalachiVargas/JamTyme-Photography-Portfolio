Project Overview:

The goal is to create an elegant portfolio to display a photographer’s photos and videos with the intention of directing potential customers to future photo bookings.
The website is a portfolio that shares both the artist’s content and personality.
The intended users of the site are other photographers who enjoy the artist’s work, fans of the artist that want to learn more personal details, and customers that need photography for their (businesses, models, weddings, events).
The website will have five pages. The home page, about me, photo gallery, video reel, and pricing/booking information. Each site will have minimal design and a concise message leading to a call to action.
